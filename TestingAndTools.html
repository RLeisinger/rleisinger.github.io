Three tier testing approach

</ol>

<h2>Automated Testing</h2>
Automated testing to remove noise and easily detected issues. <br>
Automated testing can be as simple as a browser plugin to test/report in a CI Cycle.<br>
Automated testing is code on code testing, disability is a human experience.<br>
Zero errors in automated testing does not equal an accessible experience.<br>
Zero errors in automated testing does reduce your risk in the case that someone runs an automated tested against your site/app.<br>

<h3>Automated test systems</h3>

<h4>Browser Plugins</h4>

<a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WebAim</a><br> 
Really simple quick way to find code errors on a page<br>
Web centric, good for content creator and quick checks
<p>	
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-insights-fo/pbjjkligggfmakdaogkfomddhfmpjeni?hl=en">Microsoft Insights</a><br> 
More complex. Includes some interesting tools and suggestions for testing workflow<br>
Has a simple FastPass Option or more in depth Assessment mode
<p>
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tenon-check/bmibjbhkgepmnehjfhjaalkikngikhgj?hl=en-US">Tenon</a><br>
Slow to process, but detailed and uses a cool concept of measuring the density of errors.<br>
Fits into their full suit of tools.<br>
<p>
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc?hl=en-US">SiteImprove</a><br>
I generally recommend this one if people are already using SiteImprove for its other features, as it integrates nice with their reporting and dashboards. Nothing that exciting about the standalone plugin.
<p>
<a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">Deque’s aXe</a><br>
Quality tools, not easy to access. Work with Deque’s other products. Developer centric.

<h4>APIs & Code</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://tenon.io/get-code/">Tenon</a><br>
Robust integrations with a lot of CMS platforms, linting and CI.<br>
This is where geek meets accessibility
<p>
<a href="https://wave.webaim.org/api/">WebAim API</a><br>
Simple to call. Simple to understand. Build your own reports and dashboards or work with their partner <a href="https://dinolytics.com/">Dinolytics</a>
<p>
<a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/axe-for-web/documentation/api-documentation/">Deque aXe</a><br>
Seriously in depth API
