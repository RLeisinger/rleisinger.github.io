	<h1>PERCEIVABLE</h1>
	<section>
		<h2>1.3.4 Orientation (AA)</h2>
		Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.
</section>

<section>
	<h2>1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (AA)</h2>
	The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined.
	<p>
		HTML5.2 autocomplete values autocomplete="tel"
</section>
<section>
	<h2>1.4.10 Reflow</h2>
	Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions
	<p>
		Exceptions: images, maps, diagrams, video, games, presentations, data tables, and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content
</section>
<section>
<h2>1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (AA)</h2>
The visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):<br>
UI & Graphical Objects
</section>
<section>
	<h2>1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA)</h2>
	In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties,
	no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:
<p>
Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times<br>
Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times<br>
Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times<br>
Word spacing to at least 0.16 time<br>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (AA)</h2>
	Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Dismissable</li>
		<li>Hoverable</li>
		<li>Persistent</li>
	</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>Operable</h1>
	<section>
		<h2>2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A)</h2>
		If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true:
		<ul>
			<li>Turn off</li>
			<li>Remap</li>
			<li>Active only on focus</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A)</h2>
		All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation</h2>
		For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true:
		<ul>
			<li>No Down-Event</li>
			<li>Abort or Undo</li>
			<li>Up Reversal</li>
			<li>Essential</li>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>2.5.3 Label in Name</h2>
		For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text,
		the name contains the text that is presented visually.
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A)</h2>
		Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by user interface components and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when:
<ul>
<li>Supported Interface</li>
<li>Essential</li>
</ul>

	</section>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>Robust</h1>
	<h2>4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)</h2>
	In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.
