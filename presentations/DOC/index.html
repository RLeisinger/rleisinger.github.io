		<b>Established and testable standard</b><br>
		<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">WCAG 2.1</a> is a stable, referenceable technical standard.
				<p>It has 13 guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. For each guideline, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA.

							 <!-- POUR Slide -->
													<!---		<section>
															<h1>Principals</h1>
																	<section id="fragments"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_LgSwVWKtSU/VX7UaReOxJI/AAAAAAAAGf4/9OCjrIfWB1Y/s1600/POUR_Illustration_03%255B1%255D.png" alt="4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust"></section>
																	<section id="fragments">
																			<h2>Perceivable</h2> Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
																			<p>
																			This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)</p>
																	</section>

							<section id="fragments">
									<h2>Operable</h2> User interface components and navigation must be operable.
									<p>
									This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform) </p>
									</section>
									<section id="fragments">
									<h2>Understandable</h2> Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
											<p>This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)</p>
									</section>
										<section id="fragments">

									<h2>Robust</h2> Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
							<p>This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)</p>
																	</section>
															</section>

															<section>
															<h1>Guidelines</h1>
															<section>
															Guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques.
</section> -->
<!--- <section>

<ul>
	<li>Principle: 1 Perceivable</li>
	<li>Guidelines: 1.1 Text Alternatives</li>
</ul>
<p>
Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
</section>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Success Criteria</h1>

<section>
Basis for determining conformance are the sucess criteria, not techniques
<ul>
	<li>Guidelines: 1.1 Text Alternatives</li>
	<li>Success Criterion: 1.1.1 Non-text Content</li>
	<p>
</ul>
<p>
1.1.1 Non-text Content: All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. (Level A)
Controls and inputs (covered by 4.1), Time based media (covered by 1.2)
</section>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>Techniques</h1>

<section>
Specific situational details
<ul>
	<li>Guidelines: 1.1 Text Alternatives</li>
	<li>Success Criterion: 1.1.1 Non-text Content</li>
	<li>Techniques: Situation (A) > List of Techniques for Situation</li>
	Also Intent, Benefits, Examples and Related Resources
</ul>
<P>
	Exmples: data chart, audio recording of speech, linked thumbnail image

<section>
	<h1>2. Operable</h2>
		<section>
			<h2>Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible</h2>
Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard</h2>
(Level A)<br>
All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.

		<h2>Benefits</h2>
		<ul>
<li>People who are blind (who cannot use devices such as mice that require eye-hand coordination)</li>
<li>People with low vision (who may have trouble finding or tracking a pointer indicator on screen)</li>
<li>Some people with hand tremors find using a mouse very difficult and therefore usually use a keyboard</li>
